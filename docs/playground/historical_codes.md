I chose the name ‚ÄúM6502.MAC‚Äù to be consistent with the MACRO-10 file extension used by the Microsoft BASIC for 8080 sources.",

But in less than 30 seconds, the computer experts in Mission Control relayed that the AGC software was doing just what it was supposed to: drop lower-priority work and restart the important jobs (so quickly that it was imperceptible to the crew). Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would continue to get what they absolutely needed from the AGC to keep on the path to touchdown.\nOverflow alarms would sound three more times before Armstrong uttered ‚Äúthe Eagle has landed,‚Äù but always because things worked as intended. The word ‚Äúbailout‚Äù normally signals the failed end of a mission, but here it helped make humanity‚Äôs highest achievement a reality. ‚ÄîEllen Stofan, John and Adrienne Mars Director, Smithsonian‚Äôs National Air and Space Museum",

Or in other words, the Morris Worm ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù performed a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.\nAfter being sentenced to three years of probation, he went on to become a co-founder of celebrated startup incubator Y Combinator and an assistant professor of computer science at MIT.",
